# CS540 Course Project: Benign Overfitting in Neural Networks

The base of the repository is taken from https://github.com/niladri-chatterji/benign-deep-linear/

We have added additional experiments, loss functions and data-generation models on top of this and performed experiments based on that.

The results are available in the report here - [Report](report.pdf).
